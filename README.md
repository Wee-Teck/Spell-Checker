# Spell Checker

Welcome to the Spell Checker repository! This project aims to create a spell checker tool that suggests the closest word and detects errors in words, similar to Google's "Did you mean" functionality.

## Goals

The primary goal of this project is to develop a reliable and efficient spell checker that can be integrated into any website or application. In addition, the following goals have been identified:

- Implement trie and suffix tree data structures to optimize word search and suggestion
- Use the edit distance algorithm to suggest and correct spelling errors
- Develop a user-friendly interface for easy integration with other web technologies
- Test the spell checker thoroughly to ensure accuracy and reliability

## Approach

To achieve the goals mentioned above, the following approach will be taken:

1. Research and understand the trie and suffix tree data structures, as well as the edit distance algorithm, and their applications in spell checking
2. Develop a prototype spell checker using Javascript
3. Optimize the spell checker by implementing trie and suffix tree data structures
4. Improve the spell checker's suggestion and correction accuracy using the edit distance algorithm
5. Create a user-friendly interface for easy integration with other web technologies
6. Test the spell checker thoroughly using a variety of inputs and edge cases

## Future Plans

Once the spell checker is fully developed and tested, the plan is to create an independent website for it. The website will showcase the features and functionality of the spell checker. In addition, the following features are being considered for future updates:

- Contextual suggestions and corrections
- Integration with popular web development frameworks


Thank you for your interest in the Spell Checker project!
